===============

This fork support SSL TLS STARTTLS.  It also no longer uses Socket connection and replaced with TCPClient.  This also now uses NetworkStream to utilize SslStream.

netDumbster is a .Net Fake SMTP Server clone of the popular Dumbster (http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/)

netDumbster is based on the API of nDumbster (http://ndumbster.sourceforge.net/default.html) and the nice C# Email Server (CSES) written by Eric Daugherty.
